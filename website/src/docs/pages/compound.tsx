    'Variant axes are independent by design — but sometimes a combination needs its own treatment. A small danger button might need extra weight; a selected row that is also disabled needs muting. Compound blocks express exactly that: matchers naming variant values, plus slot styles that apply only when every matcher holds: component Button {\n  variants {\n    size { sm { padding: space.1 space.3; } lg { padding: space.3 space.5; } }\n    tone { primary { background: color.primary; } danger { background: color.danger; } }\n  }\n  defaults { size: lg; tone: primary; }\n\n  compound {\n    size: sm;\n    tone: danger;\n\n    root {\n      font-weight: 700;\n      text-transform: uppercase;\n      letter-spacing: 0.02em;\n    }\n  }\n} Matchers (size: sm;) and slot blocks (root { … }) share the compound body — the parser tells them apart by punctuation. A compound adds no props and no new API; it refines what existing props produce. Matching semantics At runtime, the generated function evaluates each variant to its effective value — the prop if passed, otherwise the default — and applies a compound\'s classes when all of its matchers equal those effective values. Defaults count: Button() with defaults size: sm, tone: danger does trigger the compound above without any props. what a call returns Button({ size: "sm", tone: "danger" }).root\n// "Button_root_… Button_size_sm_root_… Button_tone_danger_root_…\n//  Button_size_sm_tone_danger_root_…"   ← the compound class\n\nButton({ size: "sm" }).root\n// no compound class — tone resolves to its default "primary" With responsive object props, compounds match the static value — the initial entry (or default). A variant that only becomes sm at a breakpoint does not flip compounds on and off mid-media-query; combination styling stays predictable. Pushing it further Compounds compose along every dimension the language has. Multiple `compound` blocks stack — each matching one applies, in source order. A compound can match three or more axes, style several slots at once, and carry states: component Row {\n  slots { root {} title {} check {} }\n\n  variants {\n    selected { yes { background: color.primary; } no {} }\n    state    { enabled {} disabled { opacity: 0.6; } }\n    density  { normal {} compact { padding: space.1; } }\n  }\n  defaults { selected: no; state: enabled; density: normal; }\n\n  // selected rows get a visible check\n  compound {\n    selected: yes;\n    state: enabled;\n    check { opacity: 1; }\n  }\n\n  // selected + disabled: muted, not vivid\n  compound {\n    selected: yes;\n    state: disabled;\n\n    root { background: color.border; }\n    title { color: color.muted; }\n    check { opacity: 0.4; }\n  }\n\n  // three-axis: compact selected rows tighten the title too\n  compound {\n    selected: yes;\n    density: compact;\n    title { font-size: font.sm; }\n  }\n} A row that is selected, disabled, and compact matches the second and third blocks simultaneously and receives both class sets. Think of compounds as additive patches over the variant grid, not branches of an if/else. states inside a compound slot compound {\n  size: sm;\n  tone: danger;\n\n  root {\n    font-weight: 700;\n    &:hover { filter: brightness(1.1); }   // hover, only for sm + danger\n  }\n} Cascade position Compound classes are emitted after base and variant classes in the stylesheet and have the same single-class specificity — so when a compound and a variant set the same property, the compound wins. That ordering is the entire mechanism; there is no specificity arms race. Checked, like everything else Mistake Diagnostic Matcher names a variant the component lacks ARV121 Matcher names a value the axis lacks ARV122 Same variant matched twice in one block ARV126 Empty compound (no matchers or no styles) ARV123 — a warning; compilation continues. If you keep writing the same pair of matchers, that pair probably wants to be a real axis. Compounds shine for exceptions; when a combination is the rule, model it directly as a variant.',
