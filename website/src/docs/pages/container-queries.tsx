    'A breakpoint answers the wrong question for reusable components: a card needs to know how wide it is, not how wide the screen is — the same card may render in a 300px sidebar and a 900px main column on one page. Container blocks switch variants based on the component\'s own rendered width: src/theme.arv theme {\n  container {\n    wide = 480px;\n  }\n} card.arv component Card {\n  slots { root {} media {} body {} }\n\n  base {\n    display: flex;\n    flex-direction: column;\n    gap: space.3;\n  }\n\n  variants {\n    layout {\n      stacked {}\n      row {\n        flex-direction: row;\n        media { width: 40%; }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  defaults { layout: stacked; }\n\n  container {\n    wide { layout: row; }   // ≥ 480px of available width → row\n  }\n} Container sizes live in the theme\'s container group, exactly parallel to breakpoints. The block reads: when this component\'s container is at least 480px wide, the layout variant becomes row — wherever that happens to occur on screen. What the compiler sets up Container queries need an element declared as a measurement container. Arvia handles that: a component with a `container` block gets `container-type: inline-size` on its root automatically, and the override styles are wrapped in `@container`: generated CSS .Card_root_0cgz70 {\n  container-type: inline-size;\n}\n\n.Card_layout_row_root_0cgz70 {\n  flex-direction: row;\n}\n\n@container (min-width: 480px) {\n.Card_layout_row_cq_wide_root_0cgz70 {\n  flex-direction: row;\n}\n} The measured container is the nearest ancestor with a container-type — for this component\'s children, its own root. Sizing the root itself with a container query is impossible by CSS\'s rules (a container cannot query itself), which is why container overrides are most useful on inner slots and layout properties. Call-site control with $ keys Like `responsive` blocks, container behavior is also available per call site. Container keys are prefixed with $ to keep the two query kinds distinct in one object: App.tsx Card({ layout: { initial: "stacked", $wide: "row" } }); generated .d.ts export type CardProps = {\n  layout?: "stacked" | "row" | { initial?: "stacked" | "row"; "$wide"?: "stacked" | "row"; };\n}; The semantics mirror responsive props exactly: passing a plain value pins the variant and disables the component\'s `container` block for it; the object form sets the initial value and per-container-size overrides; and the available $ keys are the ones the component\'s `container` block declared. Mixing viewport and container A component can carry both blocks, and one variant can be driven by both. The object prop form then accepts both key kinds — bare names are breakpoints, $-names are container sizes: theme {\n  breakpoint { md = 768px; }\n  container { wide = 480px; }\n}\n\ncomponent Toolbar {\n  variants {\n    density { compact { gap: space.1; } cozy { gap: space.3; } }\n  }\n  defaults { density: compact; }\n\n  responsive { md { density: cozy; } }     // page got roomier\n  container { wide { density: cozy; } }    // or just this toolbar did\n}\n\n// Toolbar({ density: { initial: "compact", md: "cozy", $wide: "cozy" } }) Both query kinds emit additive classes with the same specificity, so when several apply the later stylesheet rule wins. In practice the rule of thumb stays simple: viewport for page chrome, container for everything you expect to drop into unknown layouts. A worked example The payoff is components that are correct by construction wherever they land. This stat panel switches to a horizontal layout only when its spot actually affords it: stat-panel.arv component StatPanel {\n  slots { root {} value {} label {} delta {} }\n\n  base {\n    use Surface;\n    display: flex;\n    flex-direction: column;\n    gap: space.1;\n    padding: space.4;\n\n    value { font-size: font.xl; font-weight: 700; }\n    label { color: color.muted; font-size: font.sm; }\n  }\n\n  variants {\n    arrangement {\n      stacked {}\n      inline {\n        flex-direction: row;\n        align-items: baseline;\n        gap: space.3;\n        value { font-size: font.lg; }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  defaults { arrangement: stacked; }\n\n  container {\n    wide { arrangement: inline; }\n  }\n} Dashboard.tsx // Same component, no props, both placements correct:\n<aside className={sidebar}>\n  <StatPanelView />   {/* 280px slot → stacked */}\n</aside>\n<main className={main}>\n  <StatPanelView />   {/* 720px slot → inline, automatically */}\n</main> Name container sizes by meaning (wide, full, split) rather than by pixel value — the threshold lives in the theme and can be tuned once for every component that uses it.',
