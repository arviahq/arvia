    'Responsive behavior in Arvia is variant switching: instead of writing media queries by hand, you say which variant value applies from which breakpoint up. Breakpoints are tokens, declared once in the theme: src/theme.arv theme {\n  breakpoint {\n    md = 768px;\n    lg = 1024px;\n  }\n} button.arv component Button {\n  variants {\n    size {\n      sm { padding: space.1 space.3; }\n      lg { padding: space.3 space.5; }\n    }\n  }\n\n  defaults { size: sm; }\n\n  responsive {\n    md { size: lg; }    // from 768px up, default to lg\n  }\n} Read the `responsive` block as overrides to defaults: below 768px a prop-less Button is sm; at 768px and above it becomes lg. Everything is mobile-first min-width — declare the small state as the default and step upward. generated CSS .Button_size_sm_root_0tbkbv { padding: 4px 12px; }\n.Button_size_lg_root_0tbkbv { padding: 16px 20px; }\n\n@media (min-width: 768px) {\n.Button_size_lg_bp_md_root_0tbkbv { padding: 16px 20px; }\n} The breakpoint variant gets its own media-wrapped class (note the bp_md segment). The component function attaches it alongside the initial value\'s class; the media query decides which one is visible. No JavaScript runs on resize — the browser does all the switching. Call-site control Callers get the same power through object props. Any variant covered by a `responsive` block accepts either a plain value or an object with an initial value and per-breakpoint overrides: App.tsx Button({ size: "sm" });                          // fixed — never switches\nButton({ size: { initial: "sm", md: "lg" } });   // switches at 768px\nButton();                                        // defaults + responsive block generated .d.ts export type ButtonProps = {\n  size?: "sm" | "lg" | { initial?: "sm" | "lg"; md?: "sm" | "lg"; };\n}; The interplay between the two layers is worth stating precisely — passing a prop takes full control of that variant: Call Below md At md and up Button() sm (default) lg (`responsive` block) Button({ size: "sm" }) sm sm — an explicit prop switches the `responsive` block off for that variant Button({ size: { initial: "sm", md: "lg" } }) sm lg The object form\'s breakpoint keys come from the component\'s `responsive` block — they are what generated the media-wrapped classes. A breakpoint/value pair the component never declared has no CSS behind it, so declare in the `responsive` block whatever you want callers to use. Several axes, several breakpoints component Nav {\n  variants {\n    layout { rail { width: 64px; } full { width: 240px; } }\n    labels { hidden { label { display: none; } } shown {} }\n  }\n\n  slots { root {} label {} }\n  defaults { layout: rail; labels: hidden; }\n\n  responsive {\n    md { layout: full; }\n    lg { labels: shown; }\n  }\n} Each entry maps one breakpoint to one or more variant overrides; different axes can switch at different widths. An unknown breakpoint name is an error pointing you to the theme (ARV141). Viewport or container? Responsive blocks answer “how wide is the screen?” — the right question for page-level layout: navigation, grids, gutters. For a component that must adapt to wherever it is dropped — a card in a sidebar versus the same card in the main column — ask “how wide am I?” instead, with a `container` block. The two compose freely in one component; see [Container queries](/docs/container-queries).',
